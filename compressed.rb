# implement a method to preform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. 
# Example: 
# input: 'aabcccccaaa' returns: 'a2b1c5a3'
# If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string then the method should return the original string. 
# You can assume that the string given will only contain uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z)
